<h2 id="v2.0-alpha.9475">2013-08-26 (<a href="https://github.com/textmate/textmate/compare/v2.0-alpha.9459...v2.0-alpha.9475">v2.0-alpha.9475</a>)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Support <code>${var}</code> in regexp part of format string transformations. For example if you wish the file name in the window title to be relative to <code>$CWD</code> (current directory of the <code>.tm_properties</code> file) then you can now add:</p>

<pre><code>windowTitle = '${TM_FILEPATH:?${TM_FILEPATH/${CWD}.//}:$TM_DISPLAYNAME}$windowTitleProject$windowTitleSCM'
</code></pre>

<p>The example makes use of two constructs, the outer being <code>${var:?«if set»:«if not set»}</code> and the inner being the regexp substitution. I used <code>.</code> to match the trailing slash that we also want to remove, mainly to avoid having to use escapes (if we wanted to use a literal slash).</p></li>
<li><p>Using <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃T</kbd> has been improved for the case where two “things” are selected delimited by some operator. It will now swap the two “things” rather than reverse the characters. You can see <a href="https://github.com/textmate/textmate/blob/master/Frameworks/editor/tests/t_transform.cc">examples in the test file</a>.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>TextMate now listens to <code>rmate</code> connections via IPv6 meaning that if you are using an ssh tunnel, you should use <code>localhost</code> instead of <code>127.0.0.1</code>. Also worth mentioning that <code>rmate</code> is once again a <a href="https://github.com/textmate/rmate">standalone script</a> that can be installed without needing rubygems.</li>

<ul>
<li>Add Quick Look generator for file types conforming to <code>public.source-code</code>. <span class='credit'>Jacob Bandes-Storch</span></li>
<li>Folder search now supports UTF-16/32 encoding. If document is not in UTF, TextMate will try a potential <code>encoding</code> set in <code>.tm_properties</code> (in a <code>attr.file.unknown-encoding</code> section). <span class='credit'>Jasmin Lapalme</span></li>
<li>Add source list style setting for the file browser. Run <code>defaults write com.macromates.TextMate.preview fileBrowserStyle SourceList</code> and relaunch TextMate to enable. <span class='credit'>Jacob Carlborg</span></li>

<ul>
<li><p>If a tab is sticky (settable via its context menu) then it will not close when using the batch close actions like holding option when opening a file via file chooser or file browser, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>highlightPairs</code> setting now support regular expressions. To indicate a value is a regular expression, surround it with slashes, e.g. <code>/&lt;\w+.*?&gt;/</code>. This setting is used for highlighting counterparts when caret moves over characters but you can also jump to the next/previous paired character (with same nesting level) via <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃↓</kbd>/<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃↑</kbd> and you can select the content with <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧⌘B</kbd>. The HTML bundle has been updated to declare start/end tags as pairs (<em>HTML → Settings → Miscellaneous</em>).</p></li>
<li><p>The file used for <em>Go → Go to Related File</em> (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥⌘↑</kbd>) can be set using a <code>relatedFilePath</code> setting in <code>.tm_properties</code>. If the file does not exist, TextMate will try its built-in search (which looks for files with same base name) and if nothing is found, it will create a new tab using the path specified via <code>relatedFilePath</code>. The default properties have added the following settings to allow switching between test and regular <code>*.go</code> files:</p>

<pre><code>[ *.go ]
relatedFilePath = &quot;${TM_FILEPATH/(?=\.go$)/_test/}&quot;

[ *_test.go ]
relatedFilePath = &quot;${TM_FILEPATH/_test(?=\.go$)//}&quot;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>A folder search can now be stopped via the stop button next to the status text or by pressing <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘.</kbd>. <span class='credit'>David Howden</span></p></li>

<ul>
<li>Add support for printing. You can set the theme to use in the print dialog. The font used for printing is the document font settable via <em>View → Font</em> though hardcoded to 11 points. If you want to increase the size then adjust the scale factor.</li>
<li>If you want the file chooser (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘T</kbd>) to follow symbolic links then you can add <code>followSymbolicLinks = true</code> to <code>.tm_properties</code>.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous fixes.</li>

<ul>
<li>With the find dialog showing for a document, it is now possible to use <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥⌘F</kbd> to activate “Find All”. Be aware that Edit → Find → Find All without the dialog showing is really “select all matches” (possibly limited to a selection).</li>
<li>To aid in discovery, I’ve added Edit → Select → Toggle Column Selection which shows just the option modifier key (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥</kbd>) as key equivalent, since a single-tap of option is how you switch from stream selection to column selection. This is the same as TextMate 1.x, but many still seem unfamiliar with just how easy it is to create column selections with TextMate, and subsequently, break it into multiple carets. For the latter there now is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jqc5EdZmpmQ" title="YouTube » Multiple Carets with TextMate 2">short screencast</a> in addition to the <a href="http://blog.macromates.com/2011/multiple-carets/" title="TextMate Blog » Multiple Carets">blog post about multiple carets</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>You can now <a href="javascript:TextMate.addLicense()">add your TextMate (1.x) license</a> in About → Registration.</li>
<li>Using arrow up/down with multiple carets all on same line will no longer leave the multiple carets editing mode. Instead use <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘←</kbd>/<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘→</kbd> or <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃A</kbd>/<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃E</kbd> to move all carets to the beginning or end of the line (which collapses them into a single caret).</li>
<li>Previously using <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘F</kbd> with a multiline selection would automatically set the “in” pop-up to “selection”. This is no longer the case, but can be brought back by running: <code>defaults write findInSelectionByDefault -bool YES</code></li>

<ul>
<li>A bundle’s <code>info.plist</code> can now use the <code>requiredCommands</code> key. All items in the bundle will inherit the requirements, though they are presently only checked for commands and drag commands.</li>
<li>Failing to set/remove extended attributes is no longer treated as an error (to improve compatibility with various file systems).</li>
<li>Add SOCKS proxy support for updating and crash report submissions.</li>

<h2 id="a9423">2013-05-17 (<a href="https://github.com/textmate/textmate/compare/a9419...a9423">a9423</a>)</h2>

<ul>
<li>TextMate should now work with <em>Proxy Auto Discovery</em> (for updating itself and the managed bundles).</li>
<li>A bunch of (work in progress) refactoring has caused some changes to executing commands:

<ul>
<li>Scoped variables (which are set via bundle settings) are now setup before the variables in Preferences → Variables, which in turn are setup before path specific variables (<code>.tm_properties</code>). This matters when you want to override or augment variables. For example, if you want to setup commenting style variables, you previously had to edit the existing variables found in the language’s bundle. You can now place the variables in <code>.tm_properties</code> in a group with the proper scope selector — although presently scope selectors in <code>.tm_properties</code> are matched against the file’s scope, not that of the caret (so for languages that are likely embedded, it’s still best to set the variables via a bundle item).</li>
<li>The <code>requiredCommands</code> bundle item key (to specify required shell commands) can now be used for completion commands as well. Long-term this will be usable with all types of bundle items (e.g. a snippet or macro may also require the presence of certain shell commands).</li>
<li>The working directory of the command being executed is unspecified except for drop commands (where it is the parent of the current file). We have never documented what the working directory is set to, and if you need it to be set to something specific (e.g. <code>TM_PROJECT_DIRECTORY</code>) then you should set it yourself.</li>
<li>Commands being run via <code>TextMate.system</code> (JavaScript in HTML output) no longer support being an inline shebang-script.</li>
<li>Shell code embedded in snippets and run via <code>TextMate.system</code> no longer source <code>TM_SUPPORT_PATH/lib/bash_init.sh</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>Full Screen</em> is now assigned to <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⌘F</kbd> to follow Apple’s recommendations. Previously this key was used for <em>Replace All</em> which is now instead <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⌘G</kbd> and <em>Replace All in Selection</em> is <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⇧⌘G</kbd>. This is somewhat consistent with <em>Replace &amp; Find</em> bound to <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥⌘G</kbd>.</li>
<li>The scope selector used to inject grammar rules can now match against the left scope to make the injected rule rank higher than the rules from the context it gets injected into. <span class='credit'>Joachim Mårtensson</span></li>
<li>Swipe gestures (in file browser and HTML windows) to go back/forward in history is now detected differently. Some users have reported that scrolling up/down in the file browser was sometimes triggering an undesired swipe action, hopefully the new code works better. If not, you can let me know via IRC or the mailing list.</li>
<li>The bundles in Preferences → Bundles now show link arrows to go to the bundle’s (GitHub) page where you can find its issue tracker, detailed version history, instructions on how to clone the bundle, and it’s the origin for which you can submit pull requests.</li>

<li>By default, font smoothing is now only disabled (for dark themes) on high-DPI displays. See <a href="https://github.com/textmate/textmate/wiki/Hidden-Settings#controlling-font-smoothing">wiki for how to control font smoothing</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>By default “font smoothing” is now disabled for dark themes. Font smoothing often makes light text on dark backgrounds look bolder than desired, should you however wish to have font smoothing enabled (for dark themes) you can run:</p>

<pre><code>defaults write com.macromates.TextMate.preview fontSmoothing 1
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The table showing bundles in preferences now use sortable columns. <span class='credit'>Steven Clukey</span></p></li>

<ul>
<li>Macros can now be saved via Edit → Macros → Save Macro… (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⌘M</kbd>). Actions invoked via Find dialog are also correctly recorded, though replaying “Replace and Find” is still unimplemented (although the action itself works when called outside macros).</li>
<li>Revert &quot;Space can be used instead of slash in file chooser (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘T</kbd>)&quot;. See <a href="https://github.com/textmate/textmate/issues/893">issue #893</a> for discussion.</li>

<h2 id="a9405">2013-03-26 (<a href="https://github.com/textmate/textmate/compare/a9403...a9405">a9405</a>)</h2>

<ul>
<li>When using <code>$</code> in a scope selector we anchor the match to the content scope’s end. For example <code>string $</code> will match <code>source string attr.scm.git</code> because the last part (<code>attr.scm.git</code>) is not part of the content scope. <span class='credit'>Joachim Mårtensson</span></li>
<li>Installing bundles from within TextMate should no longer stall/fail on volumes where file system events are not generated. Installing from outside TextMate still require proper events to be generated. If your bundles are stored on a volume that does not generate these events then you will need to delete <code>~/Library/Caches/com.macromates.TextMate/BundlesIndex.plist</code> and relaunch TextMate to have it re-index your <code>Bundles</code> folders. Normally local file systems do generate file system events but <a href="https://github.com/andreyvit/find-fsevents-bugs">problems appear to exist</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Add <em>Filter Through Command</em> bound to <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘|</kbd>. I am aware that this keybinding might not work for all users. For now you will have to rebind manually via <em>System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts</em>.</p>

<p>The dialog doesn’t include all the options of 1.x, but I think most of that wasn’t being used, and by keeping the choices limited, we can improve keyboard usability. A few options are however likely going to appear, like indication of the input unit (which presently is selection and falling back on document) and outputting to a new window. <span class='credit'>Jacob Bandes-Storch + Allan Odgaard</span></p></li>

<h2 id="a9397">2013-03-17 (<a href="https://github.com/textmate/textmate/compare/r9395...a9397">a9397</a>)</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can now set the current window’s project folder via the file browser. Click the folder in the top bar and there should be an option to use the current folder as project folder. Project folder is the default location for project searches (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧⌘F</kbd>), file chooser (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘T</kbd>), and many commands will fallback on project folder (e.g. build commands).</li>
<li>The file chooser (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘T</kbd>) will now treat space the same as slash, i.e. enable full path filtering.</li>
<li><code>rmate</code> has been turned into a ruby gem and can be installed with <code>gem install rmate</code> on servers that have <code>gem</code> available.</li>
<li>The bundle history in this window (which you can get to by pressing <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘3</kbd>, <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘}</kbd>, or <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥⌘→</kbd>) now only list history for 2012 and 2013, which should make showing the history much faster.</li>
<li>Don’t use <code>POSIX_SPAWN_CLOEXEC_DEFAULT</code> on 10.7 to avoid kernel panic. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/squatch">squatch</a> for debugging this.</li>
<li>Fix type of <code>rmate</code> listen port in <em>Preferences → Terminal</em>. If this value shows with a thousand separator you need to manually remove the separator character and press return to get rid of the old (bad) value.</li>
<li>I changed the <code>r</code> prefix on the build number to <code>a</code>. Previously it was short for “revision”, but since I may reset the counter once we go from alpha → beta → release, it should use the build’s status as prefix.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a9395">2013-03-13 (<a href="https://github.com/textmate/textmate/compare/r9393...r9395">a9395</a>)</h2>

<ul>
<li>When estimating indent we now use per-line indent patterns to avoid having multi-line block comments above the caret affect the estimated indent level.</li>
<li>New scoped setting: <code>zeroIndentPattern</code>. Lines matches by this pattern get zero indent but does not affect the indent of following lines. Probably only useful for C preprocessor lines, maybe also code lines in template languages that support a “begin of line” character as an alternative to wrapping the code in special syntax.</li>
<li>Window resize when toggling file browser can now be disabled in <em>Preferences → Projects</em>. The behavior has however seen a few improvements (accounting for browser on left side of window and reusing old frame on second toggle, instead of calculating a new frame).</li>
<li>Introduce <code>TM_MATE</code> environment variable which bundle commands should use when they wish to call <code>mate</code> (previously the convention was to use <code>&quot;$TM_SUPPORT_PATH/bin/mate&quot;</code>).</li>
<li>The <em>Edit → Select → None</em> (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧⌘A</kbd>) menu item has been moved to the file browser’s action menu, as the key is always sent to the file browser.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Assign <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⌘↩</kbd> to View → Enter / Exit Full Screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Rework find dialog: This is work in progress but I don’t think any functionality is missing compared to previous build, although some functionality might be less polished, e.g. the action buttons don’t properly enable/disable and the height of the results list gets lost when hiding it.</p>

<p>Some of the stuff that has changed / improved:</p>

<ul>
<li>The find/replace text fields adjust their height to encompass the content. Presently though the initial height of the controls is one line regardless of content (but they should adjust on first edit).</li>
<li>You can use Save All (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥⌘S</kbd>) to save affected files after Replace All.</li>
<li>The key equivalents / actions available in the Find dialog is now easier to find via the action pop-up, which also improves accessibility.</li>
<li>Using Find Next (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘G</kbd>) or Previous (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧⌘G</kbd>) with search results will move selection up/down.</li>
<li>Using Find All with ‘in’ set to ‘Selection’ will find and select all matches in the current document, though it might be more desirable to show the results in the find dialog (like Find All does for a document or folder).</li>
<li>Replace and Find has been implemented and is bound to <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥⌘G</kbd>.</li>

<li>Add “scroll past end” option to the View menu. Enabling this means that the last line of the document is no longer anchored to the bottom but can e.g. be centered in the view port. <span class='credit'>Steven Clukey</span></li>
<li>Improve voice over / accessibility support: The editor (with status bar) and file browser are now two distinct groups and all image buttons have descriptive accessibility attributes. <span class='credit'>Boris Dušek</span></li>

<ul>
<li>When toggling the file browser, the window will adjust its width. Likewise the width of new windows depend on wether or not the file browser is initially visible.</li>
<li>Updated key equivalents for the <em>File</em> menu. Also added 3 new items: <em>New File</em>, <em>New Folder</em>, and <em>Close All Tabs</em>. The first two actions were previously only available through the file browsers action menu.</li>
<li>For HTML views we now only treat two-finger left/right scroll as a swipe gesture if no scroll can be performed (i.e. the content is at its leftmost or rightmost position).</li>
<li>Deleting symbolic links in the file browser would trash the item that the link pointed to, instead of the link itself.</li>
<li>Commands which use the <code>requiredCommands</code> key (in the <code>tmCommand</code> property list) and specify a variable will now always have that variable set. Previously it was only set if the required executable was not found via <code>PATH</code>.</li>

<li><p>Themes can now specify they want to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB color profile</a>. This is done by adding the following to the theme:</p>

<pre><code>colorSpaceName = sRGB;
</code></pre>

<p>This color profile is a better choice for interoperability so new themes should use it (and we will likely convert the old themes).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>The ‘New Document’ file browser action will now create a document on disk in addition to a new tab. The type of this document (and thereby the file extension) is taken from <em>Preferences → Files → New document type</em> but you can set it per-folder via <code>.tm_properties</code>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>[ attr.untitled ]
fileType = 'source.objc++'
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The <em>Edit → Select → None</em> action bound to <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧⌘A</kbd> can now be used to deselect all in the file browser. It does not require focus to be in the file browser.</p></li>
<li><p>When focus is not in the text view then the <em>Go → Back/Forward</em> menu items get <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘[</kbd> and <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘]</kbd> as key equivalents. Additionally 10.8 users should now (also) be able to use the two-finger swipe gesture for back/forward in file browser and command output (HTML).</p></li>
<li><p><code>file</code> links in HTML output that link to directories will now open the potentially contained <code>index.html</code> (this is mainly for documentation commands).</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Starting with this build, the summary for each update is going to be shorter so if you want all the details visit GitHub by clicking the link in the heading above.</p></li>
<li><p>When you change the spelling language via <em>Edit → Spelling</em> then we record your preference as:</p>

<ol>
<li>The new default for documents without a more specific setting.</li>
<li>The current document (based on its path).</li>
<li>All documents with same path prefix as the current document (<strong>new!</strong>).</li>
</ol>

<p>We no longer store the preference for documents with same type (e.g. <code>text.html</code>) as that wasn’t useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Add bottom tool bar to file browser. The current <em>“New Document”</em> action is likely to change.</p></li>
<li><p>Relaunching as part of an software update will restore your open documents even if you disabled that option in preferences.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a9375">2013-02-08 (a9375)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>When moving focus to file browser via <em>Navigate → Move Focus to File Browser</em> (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥⌘⇥</kbd>) and there is no selection, we now select the first item (mainly to give an indication of successfully having moved focus, as there is no focus ring for this view).</p></li>
<li><p>On 10.8 TextMate will now show a notification when posting a crash report to <code>macromates.com</code>. This way the notification center provides a list of recent crashes that can be clicked to view the online version.</p></li>
<li><p>When closing other tabs (either right-clicking a tab and selecting that action or option-clicking a tab’s close button) documents which are modified but untitled are left open (rather than asking you about what to do).</p></li>
<li><p>When TextMate run commands it creates a “clean” environment, only inheriting a select few variables from its parent process. You can now alter the whitelist via the <code>environmentWhitelist</code> defaults key. This is a colon-separated list of variables to inherit. If an item in the list contains an asterisk, then it is treated as a glob.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>defaults write com.macromates.TextMate.preview environmentWhitelist '$default:MANPATH:*EDITOR'
</code></pre>

<p>Here ‘$default’ will expand to TextMate’s default whitelist.</p>

<p>Normally TextMate will setup <code>HOME</code>, <code>PATH</code>, <code>TMPDIR</code>, <code>LOGNAME</code>, and <code>USER</code>. If you whitelist any of these, then the variable (if set) will instead be inherited from the parent process.</p></li>
<li><p>TextMate now respect setting <code>disableAutoIndent</code> and <code>disableOutputAutoIndent</code> in snippet and command bundle items.</p></li>
<li><p>When inserting identical paired characters (like straight quotes), we now check the entire line to see if it’s unbalanced, rather than only what’s to the left of the caret.</p></li>
<li><p>If you check “keep bundles updated” in <em>Preferences → Software Update</em> then we no longer update the installed bundles. The index is however still kept up-to-date and it’s not recommended to disable bundle updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix issue where entering a file suffix in the file chooser (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘T</kbd>) would get a too high rank.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix searching for case-sensitive regular expressions. Previously the search would always be case insensitive.</p></li>

When you then do <em>Check Now</em> it’ll allow you to downgrade. Also, if a build gets pulled again, as was the case with r9361, staying on nightly builds also offer the downgrade option when you <em>Check Now</em> — I may make it automatically downgrade in the future, when builds are pulled, seeing how many users prefer to use the nightly builds.</li>

<h3 id="filebrowser">File browser</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added <em>Navigate → Move Focus</em> (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥⌘⇥</kbd>). This moves focus between file browser and document.</li>
<li>With focus in file browser <em>View → Show Invisibles</em> (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥⌘I</kbd>) toggles the include/exclude patterns (and thus show everything when enabled).</li>
<li>By holding option when opening a file, it will now open in TextMate, even if TextMate is not the default application for this type. <span class='credit'>Steven Clukey</span></li>
<li>Deleting items in file browser will select the succeeding item (rather than leave you with no selection).</li>
<li>Going to SCM status will now have the <em>Uncommitted Changes</em> and <em>Untracked Items</em> groups expanded by default.</li>
<li>When toggling the QuickLook preview panel (using space when focus is in file browser) will now do a zoom in/out transition.</li>
<li>When using <em>Go → Current Document</em> (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⌘R</kbd>) we drop other (non-visible) expanded folders.</li>
<li>No longer plays sounds on file renames.</li>
<li>Fix “Go to Favorites” (it went to a wrong location).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="filechooserkbdclasskeyequivalenttkbd">File chooser (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘T</kbd>)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Improve extension filtering when dealing with multiple extensions. We now only require that the extension entered (e.g. <code>.js</code>) be a subset of the file’s (e.g. <code>foo.js.erb</code>). This subset must however match the entire sub-extension. E.g. <code>.m</code> as filter string will still have <code>.md</code> files excluded.</li>
<li>Enable focus ring when 'Full Keyboard Access' is enabled. <span class='credit'>Michael Sheets</span></li>
<li>Add inactive state coloring for dividers. <span class='credit'>Michael Sheets</span></li>
<li>Tweak how we position the file chooser: Now it’s relative to the text view rather than the entire window.</li>
<li>Fix display string for untitled documents when filter string contained a slash.</li>
<li>Fix lack of clearing filter string.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="textediting">Text editing</h3>

<ul>
<li>Incremental search (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃S</kbd>) now remember last string used.</li>
<li>Dropping files on the text view, which caused a command execution, would not update the buffer (until text view was activated).</li>
<li>Fix crash related to using undo while a snippet was active. Presently the snippet is dropped if you use undo. Long-term it should be improved.</li>
<li>Improve autoscroll when using mouse to select text.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<ul>
<li>Sections in <code>.tm_properties</code> now also match folders (e.g. file browser looks up settings with just a folder rather than file, as “key”).</li>
<li>Folders you open are once again added to the <em>File → Open Recent</em> submenu.</li>
<li>The HTML output window would have a blank title, if the command didn’t output one.</li>
<li>The code signature on <code>TextMate.app</code> for r9351 wasn’t timestamped. This may have been the reason some users had Finder report that the program was broken. I have re-enabled timestamps.</li>

<h2 id="a9351">2013-01-23 (a9351)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Actions performed in the file browser now support undo. The context menu of the file browser contains undo/redo menu items, alternatively the Edit menu’s Undo and Redo actions work on the file browser, when it has focus.</li>
<li>You can now delete items on network drives but will get a warning dialog informing you that the items will be permanently deleted.</li>
<li>When you open files without extension nor identifying content (like a shebang) then they now open as plain text (instead of asking you to pick a type).</li>
<li>When you select units, e.g. via the <em>Edit → Select</em> submenu, TextMate does a more intelligent job of making the selection visible, and if only a subset can be shown, it no longer scrolls to the bottom of the selection.</li>
<li>Add scope bar to file chooser (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘T</kbd>) and do various visual improvements. The <em>Uncommitted Documents</em> source is currently unavailable.</li>
<li>Improve speed of rendering styled text. <span class='credit'>Joachim Mårtensson</span></li>
<li>If your clipboard data contains <code>&lt;NUL&gt;</code> characters then these can now be pasted into TextMate.</li>
<li>Default theme has been changed to Twilight, default location for (HTML) command output is set to new window, and the position of the file browser now defaults to the right side. As for the latter, it takes some getting used to, but give it a chance, as it means your text doesn’t “move” depending on wether or not the file browser is visible.</li>

<article>
<h2 id="a9349">2013-01-21 (a9349)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Rework file chooser (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘T</kbd>):
It now show document icons (with potential SCM status) and close buttons for open documents. Filtering has also seen some minor improvements, mainly related to “full path” filtering (which you activate by putting a slash in the filter string). Performance should be better when dealing with large directories (try e.g. <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘↑</kbd> to move to the parent of your current folder), this mainly relates to not stalling the application (the scanning itself could likely be a little faster).
Presently though a few things are missing:

<ul>
<li>You can no longer use <code>@</code> to descend into a file and see its symbols (will be added back).</li>
<li>The close buttons are not yet hooked up.</li>
<li>There is no UI for switching “source” but you can use <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘1</kbd> and <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘2</kbd> to switch between all files and open files, where the latter now actually works.</li>
<li>The look is provisional.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Opening multiple documents at once will now select the last one so that <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘W</kbd> can be used to go through them. Try e.g. holding down shift when using arrow keys in the file chooser.</p></li>
<li><p>When you open documents and select to “close other” then it leaves modified documents open rather than ask about saving them. Try e.g. holding down option (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥</kbd>) when you hit <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>↩</kbd> in the file chooser.</p></li>
<li><p>When you open the file chooser, we look at the find clipboard to see if it contains something of the form <code>«file»:«line»</code> and if so, uses that as the default filter string. This “matching” now also works if the file contains slashes. The idea is that when you have “error output” e.g. in your terminal, you can select it, hit <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘E</kbd> and switch to TextMate where you hit <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘T</kbd> + <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>↩</kbd> to go directly to the file + line. If you find yourself doing it a lot, you may like the automator workflow described in <a href="https://github.com/textmate/textmate/issues/665">issue #665</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Restyle navigation bar to be more in line with Lion. <span class='credit'>Michael Sheets</span></p></li>
<li><p>We now download software updates to the system’s cache folder (instead of temporary folder). This should hopefully fix the problem some ware having with the “temp cleaner” waking up before the update got installed. If you still get this warning, let me know.</p></li>
<li><p>The encoding pop-up in <em>Preferences → Files</em> would reset itself to UTF-8 after a relaunch (which really should have been viewed as a feature :) ).</p></li>
<li><p>Fix crash introduced in r9345.</p></li>
</ul>

<article>
<h2 id="a9347">2013-01-17 (a9347)</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you have “open documents from last session” enabled in preferences then TextMate will no longer ask you to save untitled documents when you quit, as these will be restored next time you launch it, and as they are untitled, no other program can edit them (causing a conflict, as would be the case if the document had a location on disk).</li>
<li>If the ‘inode’ of an open file changed (e.g. because of <code>git stash</code>/<code>rebase</code>) and you opened the file again (e.g. via <code>mate</code>) then TextMate would open a new tab, even though the file was already open.</li>
<li>Add “Show in Finder” context menu when no items are selected. <span class='credit'>Caleb Land</span></li>
<li>Make OakTabBarView and OakPasteboardSelector accessible. <span class='credit'>Boris Dušek</span></li>
<li>The tab bar will again close excess tabs to keeping it from overflowing.</li>

<h2 id="a9345">2013-01-13 (a9345)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>File browser has a new navigation bar. This is work in progress. You can find most actions of the old bar in the Go menu (where you can also see the key equivalents). Presently missing is “Show Hidden Items”, a toolbar below the file browser will soon appear.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve QuickLook support: When the preview panel is showing (activated by pressing space with focus in the file browser or using a file’s context menu to select Show Preview) then you can use arrow up/down to move between the files in the file browser.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve full screen support: If you quit with windows in full screen mode, these are restored in that mode. Opening windows while a window is in full screen mode no longer re-uses the (huge) dimensions of the full screen window, likewise windows opened directly in full screen mode will have a more useful size when leaving full screen mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed file chooser’s abbreviation matcher (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘T</kbd>): If you had multiple “corrections” stored for an abbreviation, all but the first of these would actually go to the bottom of the list, the opposite of what was desired.</p></li>
<li><p>Using <em>Go → Current Document</em> (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⌘R</kbd>) will no longer have the file browser switch away from your project folder but instead expand folders to make the current document visible. <span class='credit'>Jacob Bandes-Storch</span></p></li>
<li><p>Using <em>Go → Enclosing Folder</em> will select the item we came from (like Finder).</p></li>
<li><p>Previously the file browser would remember the selection state of all visited folders. This is now cleared during relaunch (except the folder currently showing) and also when using various actions that request a selection, e.g. the two previous items mentioned.</p></li>
<li><p>Using <code>exit_discard</code> in a command with HTML output will now close the output view (like 1.x did).</p></li>
<li><p>Find in Folder will now (also) use <code>excludeDirectories</code> and <code>excludeFiles</code> settings (it previously would only use those with an <code>InFolderSearch</code>-prefix).</p></li>
<li><p>Running commands with no document windows open (or in the responder chain) would miss a few essential variables from the environment (such as <code>TM_SUPPORT_PATH</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Tweaked the SCM status gathering code so there should hopefully be less overhead. People who have previously disabled SCM badges because of poor performance may wish to give them another try.</p></li>
<li><p>Various fixes to improve stability.</p></li>

<h2 id="a9341">2013-01-10 (a9341)</h2>

<ul>
<li>When you open a folder or some document(s), a default project folder will be based on the path(s) opened. This means that as long as you always open the root of your project (via <code>mate</code>, <code>open -a TextMate</code>, dragging the folder to TextMate, using the favorites (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧⌘O</kbd>), open dialog, <code>txmt:</code> URL scheme, or what have you), your project no longer requires a <code>.tm_properties</code> file setting <code>projectDirectory</code> for Find in Folder (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧⌘F</kbd>), Go to File (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘T</kbd>), and similar to work as desired. Additionally the default properties now set a window title that includes the project folder’s name (and SCM branch when available), so most projects can now also drop setting <code>windowTitle</code>. Note that windows restored from a session created prior to r9339 will not have a default project folder, so you should close and re-open the project folder, after this, the project folder will be preserved in the session save data.</li>
<li>The file browser now defaults to the project folder rather than the folder set in Preferences (the latter is still used if there is no document, e.g. after <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘N</kbd> or <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⌘N</kbd>).</li>
<li>Since opening a single document now assigns a project folder to the window, opening more documents from the same folder (or descendent folders) will have the documents open as tabs in the existing window. I <em>think</em> this takes care of the common request of having all documents opened appear in new tabs of the frontmost window.</li>
<li>The ‘Merge All Windows’ action now ignores minimized windows. This means that if you wish to only merge a few windows then you can minimize all but those you wish to merge and then perform the action.</li>
<li>Closing last tab via file browser or similar no longer close the entire window. Likewise with canceling a file open, though there’s still some work to do in this department (actually backtracking to previous state, which could mean closing the window if the window was opened only to show this document).</li>
<li>Automatic pruning of the tab bar is temporarily suspended.</li>
<li>Render glyphs in Unicode’s “private use area”.</li>
<li>The <code>open</code> command used with the <code>txmt:</code> URL scheme now supports an <code>uuid</code> parameter. This is for command runners that work with untitled documents (the current document’s UUID is available as the <code>TM_DOCUMENT_UUID</code> environment variable).</li>
<li>Fix some unsupported edge-cases with percent-escaping the <code>url</code> parameter used with the <code>txmt</code> URL scheme. Also allow tilde to be used in the URL (mainly to be 100% compatible with TextMate 1.x).</li>
<li>Clicking a ‘find all’ result would be handled twice, meaning it would open two document windows, if the project window had been closed.</li>
<li>Fix potential crash when activating the OS dictionary on an empty document.</li>
<li>The file chooser window (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘T</kbd>) was leaking in r9337 and wouldn’t terminate its scanner thread if the window was closed w/o making a selection (although it would terminate when scanning had finished). It would also throw an exception about a key/value observer not having been removed.</li>

<li>Support HTML output placed on right side (again). This can be set in Preferences → Project.</li>
<li>Opening a <code>*.tmPlugIn</code> file will now install it (hold down <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥</kbd> to open as folder). It’s no longer required that the bundle identifier of the plug-in starts with <code>com.macromates</code> but instead the plug-in’s <code>Info.plist</code> <strong>must</strong> have <code>TMPlugInAPIVersion</code> set to <code>2</code>. Despite this change, there is still no formal support for plug-ins and the internal API hasn’t stabilized, if you wish to extend TextMate (beyond what can be done via bundles) then the current way is to dig into the source.</li>
<li>Support “Select Output” as caret placement for commands.</li>
<li>When activating an already open <em>Find</em> or <em>Go to Line</em> window, it will move the window to the current space (instead of switching to the space containing the window).</li>
<li>When restoring session (after relaunch), file browser width and HTML output size is now restored individually for each window (previously there were just a global value).</li>
<li>Remove the <em>Edit → Mode</em> submenu as the menu item wasn’t hooked up. Currently you can use the tab size pop-up in the status bar to select between tabs and soft tabs.</li>

<li><p>The scope now contains <code>dyn.selection</code> and/or <code>dyn.caret.*</code> based on the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there is one or more selections: <code>dyn.selection</code>.</li>
<li>If there is a single zero-width selection: <code>dyn.caret.mixed.columnar</code>.</li>
<li>If there are multiple carets and/or selections: <code>dyn.caret.mixed</code>.</li>
<li>When there is only a single caret or a single continuous selection the left scope may contain: <code>dyn.caret.begin.line</code> or <code>dyn.caret.begin.document</code>.</li>
<li>Likewise the right scope may contain: <code>dyn.caret.end.line</code> or <code>dyn.caret.end.document</code>.</li>

<li><p>When expanding tab triggers, the left scope is the scope to the left of the start of the potential tab trigger and the right scope is likewise that to the right of the potential tab trigger.</p></li>

<h2 id="a9317">2012-09-29 (a9317)</h2>

<ul>
<li>New semantic class: <code>callback.document.will-save</code>. This can be used to have a command called prior to saving a document, the command could e.g. strip trailing whitespace or ensure the document has a <code>LF</code> character on last line. Two minor issues is that selection is currently lost after running a “did save” command (when it replaces entire document) and caret is scrolled into the visible area.</li>
<li>The about window has been combined with credits, release notes, and a new option allows you to see changes for installed bundles, although presently not much is showing, as you’ll need updated bundles before version information is available (so a lot of info should show in a few days when the various bundles have auto-updated). <span class='credit'>Rasmus Abrahamsen</span></li>
<li>If the file browser was showing a lot of items, editor speed would be affected. There still is an issue opening/closing files or when a document goes from modified to non-modified or vice versa.</li>
<li>Fix issues with lack of resizing the gutter.</li>

<h2 id="a9313">2012-09-21 (a9313)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Add indent aware begin/end of line action methods.</p>

<p>The methods going to “begin of indented line” will go to the first non-whitespace character on the line, unless the caret is already there or to the left of this character, in which case it will go to the actual beginning of the line.</p>

<p>The “end of indented line” methods work similarly.</p>

<p>If you want (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧</kbd>)<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘⇠</kbd>/<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘⇢</kbd> and <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘⌫</kbd>/<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘⌦</kbd> to use this behavior, you can add the following to your key bindings file:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;@\UF702&quot;  = &quot;moveToBeginningOfIndentedLine:&quot;;
&quot;$@\UF702&quot; = &quot;moveToBeginningOfIndentedLineAndModifySelection:&quot;;
&quot;@\UF703&quot;  = &quot;moveToEndOfIndentedLine:&quot;;
&quot;$@\UF703&quot; = &quot;moveToEndOfIndentedLineAndModifySelection:&quot;;
&quot;@\U007F&quot;  = &quot;deleteToBeginningOfIndentedLine:&quot;;
&quot;@\UF728&quot;  = &quot;deleteToEndOfIndentedLine:&quot;;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you create a set of local key bindings then they no longer eclipse the default set. For the records, key bindings are consulted in the following order:</p>

<pre><code>~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/KeyBindings.dict
/path/to/TextMate.app/Contents/Resources/KeyBindings.dict
~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict
/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict
/System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Resources/StandardKeyBinding.dict
</code></pre>

<p>If you edit any of the above files you will need to relaunch TextMate (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⌘Q</kbd>) before the changes take effect.</p></li>
<li><p>The gear icon in the Find in Folder status bar (above the results view) now have four flavors of copying the results to the clipboard. These work on the selected items falling back to all matches, if there is no selection (here selection means actual list view selection, not “checked” via the check boxes).</p></li>
<li><p>Launching commands from TextMate now only inherit a few whitelisted variables from the process that launched TextMate. This should fix inconsistencies between running TextMate from the shell versus Finder, and in the former case, avoid problems if you set <code>RUBYOPT</code> or similar.</p></li>
<li><p>When moving the selection and padding is inserted, we no longer extend the selection to include this padding.</p></li>
<li><p>Moving selection left/right with an east asian character on left/right side would insert a space rather than move the selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating new files via New Tab no longer have the file show up in the Open Recent menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Opening files via <code>mate</code> no longer have the item show up in the Open Recent menu. Though you can call <code>mate --recent</code> to force the file to appear (or make an alias). The rationale is that <code>mate</code> is often used to edit temporary files like commit messages and that the shell history serves as an alternative to “Open Recent”.</p></li>
<li><p>If more than 256 KB of text was selected, running commands would fail, as the <code>TM_SELECTED_TEXT</code> variable exceeded <code>ARG_MAX</code> which would cause <code>execve</code> to fail. If more than 256 KB of text is selected we now set the <code>TM_SELECTED_TEXT</code> variable to a placeholder.</p></li>
<li><p>Add some checks that should prevent a crash when system ask about text metrics (with a bogus text index). Unsure exactly under which circumstance the crash happens, but likely related to the system-wide dictionary service or multi-lingual input.</p></li>
<li><p>Update <code>rmate</code>: Saving would fail if editing <code>file</code> and <code>file~</code> already existed.</p></li>
<li><p>If <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘</kbd>-clicking a single caret two times, TextMate would crash, as <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘</kbd>-clicking an existing caret normally removes that caret, except when there is only a single one, in that case, it would (wrongly) add a caret leaving two carets at the same position, and make the second click remove both of these two carets, leaving the editor with no carets.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix crash when clicking exactly on the split view dividers.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix potential crash when quitting TextMate (in <code>network::launch_tbz</code>).</p></li>

<article>
<h2 id="a9311">2012-09-18 (a9311)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Untitled documents now base their scope attributes on the file browser’s location. This mean things like <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘B</kbd> or <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘Y</kbd> will call the proper build / SCM action(s) when used in untitled documents (e.g. the initial document showing after opening a project folder via <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧⌘O</kbd> or <code>mate .</code>).</li>
<li>Previous build changed the semantics of the include/exclude patterns for the file browser: Now a file <strong>must</strong> be matched by the include pattern in order to be shown. The default patterns have been updated, but if you have edited them, or have your own include pattern in a <code>.tm_properties</code> file, then you should add the asterisk to your set of included files, e.g. <code>{*,.tm_properties,.htaccess,.gitignore}</code>.</li>
<li>I also forgot to mention that previous build is WIP with respect to the main window, presently you can size splits larger than the window, which trigger a resize, and the HTML output view can only go at the bottom. If you wish to “downgrade” an easy way is to hold down shift (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧</kbd>) when clicking “Check Now” (with the type set to “Normal Releases”).</li>
<li>The start/stop fold marker patterns are still used for a line even if that line is also matched by the fold indented block ignore pattern.</li>
<li>Fix crash which would often happen when closing document while a tool tip was showing.</li>
<li>Fix wrong document (sometimes) showing after session restore and in theory if quickly cycling through tabs of documents that hasn’t been loaded yet.</li>
<li>Previous build introduced a bug that affected bundle items with “empty” strings as values for their property list keys.</li>
<li>Column selection cursor (crosshair) should be less likely to stick (e.g. after <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥F2</kbd>).</li>
<li>Fix <code>x-insert</code> dialog command to work even when the text view doesn’t have focus. <span class='credit'>Hans-Jörg Bibiko</span></li>
<li>Fix missing curly quotes in a few dialog texts. <span class='credit'>Ryan Maxwell</span></li>

<h2 id="a9309">2012-09-16 (a9309)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Minimum dimensions are enforced when resizing the file browser or HTML output. The explicit resize buttons have been removed but dragging the dividers should now be easier, as the hot zone has been increased.</p></li>
<li><p>Setting a file type for a dot file wouldn’t stick.</p></li>
<li><p>Sections (in <code>.tm_properties</code> files) which use a scope selector now apply according to their rank (when matched against current scope) so e.g. a setting for <code>source.ruby</code> in <code>Global.tmProperties</code> will win over a setting for just <code>source</code> in a more local <code>.tm_properties</code> file.</p></li>
<li><p>Added two new variables:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>TM_APP_IDENTIFIER</code> — bundles which need to read settings from TextMate should use this instead of hardcoding <code>com.macromates.TextMate.preview</code>. Normally though bundles should <strong>not</strong> need to read TextMate settings except those they write themselves, for example the Preferences dialogs for various bundles are bound to TextMate’s user defaults.</li>
<li><code>TM_CURRENT_THEME_PATH</code> — this is the path of the current theme. Incase the theme is in delta format, it points to the base theme, long-term TextMate may store a non-delta version in a temporary folder and let it point to that, so that bundles can always assume the theme is in non-delta format.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Various improvements to glob matching:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>**</code> can now be followed by something other than <code>/</code>, e.g.: <code>src/**.{cc,mm,h}</code>.</li>
<li><code>*</code> and <code>**</code> now match leading dot when they are not followed by <code>/</code> or at the beginning of the glob, e.g. <code>main*</code> will match <code>main.cc</code>.</li>
<li>Negating a glob (by prefixing with <code>!</code>) now also rejects dot files, e.g. <code>!cache/**</code> will exclude <code>cache/.DS_Store</code> even though <code>cache/**</code> (non-negated) would not have matched that path.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Find in Folder (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧⌘F</kbd>) and File Chooser (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘T</kbd>) now exclude files matched by the “Non-text files” glob setup in <em>Preferences → Projects</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The various include/exclude globs you can set in <code>.tm_properties</code> are now aggregated. So setting <code>exclude</code> and <code>excludeDirectories</code> will exclude directories matched by either of the two globs (rather than the “most specific”).</p></li>
<li><p>Include SCM info in window title by default. This is done by having the following in <code>Default.tmProperties</code>:</p>

<pre><code>windowTitleSCM = '${TM_SCM_BRANCH:+ ($TM_SCM_NAME: $TM_SCM_BRANCH)}'
windowTitle    = '$TM_DISPLAYNAME$windowTitleSCM'
</code></pre>

<p>Incase you want to set a custom window title but keep the SCM info you can use the <code>windowTitleSCM</code> variable, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>windowTitle     = '$TM_DISPLAYNAME — ${CWD/^.*\///}$windowTitleSCM'
</code></pre>

<p>Exploiting the way sections with scope selectors are now evaluated last, it is possible to set a global window title based on a potential <code>projectDirectory</code> variable. E.g. put the following in <code>~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Global.tmProperties</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[ 'attr, ' ]
windowTitleProject = '${projectDirectory:+ — ${projectDirectory/^.*\///}}'
windowTitle        = '$TM_DISPLAYNAME$windowTitleProject$windowTitleSCM'
</code></pre>

<p>Normally we can’t use <code>projectDirectory</code> in a default/global setting, because that variable is set later, and we have no way to specify “late binding”. However, by setting it in a scope selector section we evaluate the variable after a potential <code>projectDirectory</code> has been set in a more local <code>.tm_properties</code> file. The scope selector used here is <code>attr,</code> which means all <code>attr</code> scopes or (the comma operator) the empty scope selector (which matches everything).</p>

<p>The above is just a “hack” until better solutions have been implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed Chinese translation. Since the translated interface files contain more than just strings, outdated translations affect program behavior. We’ll soon move fully to constraint-based layout which should allow translations to be purely string-based (on 10.8).</p></li>
<li><p>r9307 accidentally included a “Select Next” macro bound to <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃W</kbd> for when there was a selection. This interfered with using <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃W</kbd> with multiple carets (as presently multiple carets trigger the <code>dyn.selection.discontinuous</code> scope even if they are all zero-width).</p></li>

<li>If an open file is renamed on disk, TextMate will wait up to one second for a new file to appear before updating the document’s path.

<li><p>An image is now used as placeholder for folded text. It defaults to the color of the text’s color but you can add a theme style scoped to <code>deco.folding</code> to change it.</p></li>
<li><p>A few updates to gutter theming, the colors now need to go in their own dictionary in the theme with a key of <code>gutterSettings</code>, e.g.:</p>

<h3 id="proxyitems">Proxy Items</h3>

<p>Proxy items are bundle items with a regular scope selector, key equivalent and/or tab trigger. Their body is a “query” which will find bundle items with a semantic class matching this (simple) query string.</p>

<p>Until now we have only used this for the SCM items. None of the actions (in Git, Mercurial, Subversion, and other SCM bundles) actually have a key binding, but they all have a semantic class which start with <code>action.scm</code>.</p>

<p>There is an SCM bundle with a single proxy item bound to <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘Y</kbd> which does a query for <code>action.scm</code> so if the user press <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘Y</kbd>, it will map to the SCM actions valid in the current scope (e.g. <code>attr.scm.git</code>).</p>

<p>A few improvements has been done with respect to how proxy items appear in the interface:</p>

<ul>
<li>Proxy items in the menu now show the items matched by the query. E.g. if you look in <em>Bundles</em> → <em>SCM</em> you will see the SCM actions available. Previously you saw the proxy item. If no items are matched by the query, the proxy item itself is shown but as disabled. The idea is that we can have <em>Run</em>, <em>Documentation for Word</em>, <em>Validate Syntax</em>, and similar common actions appear in e.g. the Source bundle or (in the future) a toolbar/palette, and the user can go via these actions to run the action relevant for the current context.</li>
<li>In the bundle item chooser (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⌘T</kbd>) duplicates no longer appear (items matched would appear as a duplicate for each proxy item matching that item).</li>
<li>Items without a key equivalent but matched by a proxy item will now show the key equivalent of the proxy item. E.g. looking in the Git menu you will now see that (most of) the actions can be triggered with <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘Y</kbd>.</li>
<li>The query string in proxy items now support the <code>||</code> operator for “fallback”, e.g. we can make a proxy item with a query like: <code>action.build || format.strong</code> which will find a build action for the current context (scope) and if none is found, it will instead search for a <code>format.strong</code> (bold) action.</li>
</ul>

<p>I plan to expand the query string to also support unions, so that we can e.g. bind <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘D</kbd> to a query on <code>diff + scm.diff</code> (to show Diff actions including those for the current version control system) and additionally put a scope assertion on the class query, for example my ideal <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘B</kbd> binding would likely be a query for:</p>

<pre><code>action.build[-dyn.selection] || format.strong || action.build || action.run
</code></pre>

<p>So the first term (<code>action.build</code>) only match items if there is no selection, if there is a selection, we would instead search for a <code>format.strong</code> item, and if there isn’t any <strong>then</strong> we would look for a build action (this time even when there is a selection) and finally fallback on a run item.</p>

<p>If you have any comments on the above, please share on the <a href="http://lists.macromates.com/listinfo/textmate">mailing list</a>.</p>

<h3 id="otherchanges">Other Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Add two new action methods:</p>

<pre><code>findNextAndModifySelection:
findPreviousAndModifySelection:
</code></pre>

<p>These find the next/previous occurrence of what’s on the find clipboard and selects that, but preserves the existing selection. One could e.g. add this to <code>Keybindings.dict</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;@d&quot; = ( &quot;copySelectionToFindPboard:&quot;, &quot;findNextAndModifySelection:&quot; );
</code></pre>

<p>This binding will likely be default in an upcoming build, but bound to <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃W</kbd> (Select Word) and scoped to <code>dyn.selection</code> (so only when a word is already selected).</p></li>
<li><p>During save, the potential dialogs asking to unlock files or change encoding would not accept the user’s choice (bug recently introduced).</p></li>
<li><p>Fix out of range assertion in some cases when switching files (gutter was querying the new document using the selection used in the old one).</p></li>
<li><p>When extending a selection we now only highlight the new ranges selected rather than all of them (e.g. Find All (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥⌘F</kbd>) when there already is one instance selected or the new <code>find{Next,Previous}AndModifySelection:</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Jumping files with <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘G</kbd> (after a Find in Folder) would lead to an anchored selection, a few other cases would also cause the selection to be anchored. This is no longer the case (the subtle difference here is that unanchored selections will always extend for the initial shift (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧</kbd>) + movement action).</p></li>
<li><p>Add revision numbers to release notes. <span class='credit'>Elia Schito</span></p></li>

<h2 id="a9290">2012-08-26 (a9290)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Add context menu to tab bar. Actions include creating new tab (can also be done by double-clicking empty space in a tab bar), tearing off tabs (can also be done by double-clicking a tab), closing other tabs (can be done by option-clicking the tab’s close button), and closing tabs to the right.</p></li>
<li><p>Added badges for Subversion status. This is based on the <code>svn</code> executable rather than <code>libsvn</code>. Set <code>TM_SVN</code> to a version of <code>svn</code> compatible with your repository format. Note that if your Mac username is “long” then the driver currently fails to parse the output from <code>svn</code>. <span class='credit'>Jeremy Whitlock</span></p></li>
<li><p>Add a few new options to Project Preferences (previously these could only be enabled via <code>defaults write</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>All items in the Preferences now work, well, except for <em>Projects → Display → All filename extensions</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>When changing settings, we now save them to <code>~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Global.tmProperties</code>. This is a regular properties file (like <code>~/.tm_properties</code>) and it will try to be “smart” about how to record your preferences:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you change theme, font, wrap column, or whether or not to show the wrap column, then we store it at the root of this properties file, so it applies to all files.</li>
<li>If you change tab size, soft tabs, soft wrap, or show invisibles, then we save it for the current file type, potential parent types (e.g. <code>text</code> is a parent type of <code>text.plain</code>), and globally. This makes it easy to set different tab sizes for different languages, or enable soft wrap for text files.</li>
<li>If you change spell checking or spelling language, we store this for the current file’s path, its type, parent types, and globally.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the settings in the Preferences window are also stored in <code>Global.tmProperties</code> and if you switch file type for an open file, we also record that in this file (by adding a section for a file glob matching the current file’s extension, and setting the file type in this section).</p>

<p>We encourage you to tweak your settings and then inspect this file, as it’ll give you a feel for the possibilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Theme colors are now transparent against the background. Previously colors with alpha would be blended with a previous color setting for the same element, which was rarely desired. This mainly applies to color of invisibles and selection (which now should match the rendering done by TextMate 1.x).</p></li>
<li><p>Further improvements to theming the gutter. There are now the following keys which can be set to change the color of gutter elements: <span class='credit'>Dennis Vennink</span></p>

<ul>
<li><code>gutterDivider</code>: Border between text view and gutter.</li>
<li><code>gutterForeground</code>: Text color.</li>
<li><code>gutterBackground</code>: Background color.</li>
<li><code>gutterIcons</code>: Color of the images in the gutter.</li>
<li><code>gutterSelectionForeground</code>: Text color for lines containing caret / part of a selection.</li>
<li><code>gutterSelectionBackground</code>: Background color for lines containing caret / part of a selection.</li>
<li><code>gutterSelectionIcons</code>: Color of images on lines containing caret / part of a selection.</li>
<li><code>gutterSelectionBorder</code>: Border between selected and non-selected lines.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Changed default font to Menlo, 12 pt. Although this has been on the system for quite some time, applications which don’t use the 10.8 SDK will still receive Monaco as the default monospaced font. Unfortunately this means by default users wont see bold and italic text, as Monaco has no such variants, and CoreText will not synthesize these styles.</p></li>
<li><p>If shrinking HTML output view to (below) zero points, the view is now back again after relaunch (temporary fix for the lack of constraints on sizing views in the main window) <span class='credit'>Lukasz Czekaj</span></p></li>
<li><p>Add scope attributes for Ant, CMake, Maven and Scons projects. <span class='credit'>Michael Sheets</span></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Save dialogs now have controls for setting encoding, line endings, and whether or not to use a byte order mark (for unicode encodings).</p></li>
<li><p>When the find window is active (with find in folder results) one can use one of the View → Toggle Foldings At Level actions to collapse/expand the results. This was done to allow collapsing using the keyboard (e.g. use <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥⌘1</kbd>).</p></li>
<li><p>When in a snippet placeholder field, deleting the content and pressing tab will advance to next field even if the word to the left of the caret is a tab trigger. An example of this is <kbd class='tabTrigger'>div⇥</kbd> in HTML mode, if pressing <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌫</kbd> after expanding it, pressing <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇥</kbd> would expand another <code>div</code> snippet. When at the end of a snippet, it will allow the word to the left of the caret to trigger a tab expansion, as this is used to chain snippets.</p></li>
<li><p>Colors used in the gutter can now be set in the theme using the following 3 keys:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>gutterBackground</code></li>
<li><code>gutterForeground</code></li>
<li><code>gutterDivider</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Default colors are calculated, but might not be ideal for all themes (e.g. solarized) <span class='credit'>Jacob Bandes-Storch</span></p></li>
<li><p>Icons in the gutter has been updated for retina and images changed so the bookmark indicator is a bookmark and the “found a match here” (for search in folder) is now a magnify glass. <span class='credit'>Dennis Vennink</span></p></li>
<li><p>Last version of <code>rmate</code> didn’t preserve file permissions when editing existing files. This has now been addressed.</p></li>
<li><p>Several users reported a socket error during startup. This happened after we moved the socket into <code>TMPDIR</code> so it has now been moved back to <code>/tmp</code> but the name include the user ID to avoid clashes on multi-user systems.</p></li>
<li><p>TextMate will now update the installed version of <code>mate</code> if TextMate.app includes a newer version. This might result in prompting for admin password after updating TextMate.</p></li>

<h2 id="a9286">2012-08-19 (a9286)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Various improvements in paragraph definition and wrapping:</p>

<ul>
<li>A paragraph (the input for reformat/justify and select paragraph) is now extended up and down until there are blank lines (previously only the current (hard) line was considered part of the paragraph).</li>
<li>Paragraphs can now be selected with <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⌥P</kbd></li>
<li>Reformat/justify a paragraph (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃Q</kbd> or <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃J</kbd>) no longer leave trailing whitespace after the lines.</li>
<li>Wrap column is no longer hardcoded to 80 characters.</li>
<li>Characters with the <em>East Asian Width</em> (unicode) property set now count as two columns wide.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Selecting <em>Use Selection for Find/Replace</em> with a discontinuous or column selection now use just the first range/row.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to Current Document (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⌘R</kbd>) is now a toggle.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to SCM Status (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧⌘Y</kbd>) is now a toggle.</p></li>
<li><p>When showing SCM Status (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧⌘Y</kbd>), we no longer show folders in the <em>Uncommitted Changes</em> if items from these are also shown. In the <em>Untracked Items</em> we don’t show items as untracked if an ancestor folder is also included.</p></li>
<li><p>Find in Folder: Pressing <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘1</kbd>-<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘9</kbd> will select first match of the n’th file in the results list. Previously it only selected the n’th file (and you had to use arrow down to actually get to the match).</p></li>
<li><p>Favorites prefixed with ‘[DIR]’ show folders within.</p>

<p>For example if you have all your projects under <code>~/Projects</code> then you can do:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Favorites
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Favorites
ln -s ~/Projects &quot;[DIR] My Projects&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This will then have all the folders inside <code>~/Projects</code> show when you choose Open Favorites… (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧⌘O</kbd>).</p></li>
<li><p>When TextMate launches it creates a socket for <code>mate</code> to connect to. There have been <a href="https://github.com/textmate/textmate">a few reports</a> of TextMate reporting a problem creating this socket. We now also show an error if an old socket exist and we are unable to delete this old socket. If you are seeing an issue, please don’t just add “it fails for me too”. Instead provide as much information as possible, and if e.g. it says it failed to delete the socket, fire up Terminal and check the file flags (<code>ls -l</code>) and try to delete it from Terminal.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed: Keys on the numeric keypad can be used to trigger bundle actions (not explicitly bound to the numeric keypad). This fix removes the distinction between regular keys and the numeric keypad so it is no longer possible to bind (only) to numeric keypad keys.</p></li>
<li><p>Include high resolution (white) I-Beam cursor. <span class='credit'>Jacob Bandes-Storch</span></p></li>
<li><p>Several HiDPI assets added. <span class='credit'>Paul Wilde</span></p></li>
<li><p>Border between text view and gutter is now “fixed” (when invoking the elastic “scroll beyond the document bounds”). <span class='credit'>Jacob Bandes-Storch</span></p></li>
<li><p>Fix bundle menu items' appearance in the Help menu. <span class='credit'>Jacob Bandes-Storch</span></p></li>
<li><p>Bundle Editor: If you disable an item, you can now actually enable it again. Disabled items are rendered in grey. <span class='credit'>Gerd Knops</span></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Minor tweak to how pasting works. Previously if you did a multiline selection and on the last line selected to the end of the line but excluded the actual newline, copy and pasted that somewhere else, it would treat it as you had also copied the newline. This is now only the case when you are pasting on a line that is not empty.</p></li>

<pre><code>host: localhost

</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Improve tab trigger boundary checks. Previously a tab trigger had to be preceded by a non-word character (where underscore is considered a word character). Now we instead require that the previous character belong to a different character class (as defined by scoped settings) or has another “is alpha numeric”-state.</p></li>
<li><p>Split <code>disableIndentCorrections</code> into two settings:</p>

<p>The <code>disableIndentCorrections</code> setting disables the (aggressive) indent corrections that TextMate does while you type.</p>

<p>An additional <code>indentOnPaste</code> setting controls how to indent when pasting and can be set to:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>simple</code> — this is the indent behavior which was previously implied when setting <code>disableIndentCorrections</code>. It indents the paste to the position of the caret and works well for Python.</li>
<li><code>disable</code> — the text is inserted as-is without indenting it.</li>
<li>«unset» — indent the paste based on the indent patterns of the current scope.</li>

<p>The source for TextMate 2 is now <a href="https://github.com/textmate/textmate">available at GitHub</a> under a GPL 3 license. There is an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/08/odgaard-i-will-continue-working-on-textmate-as-long-as-i-am-a-mac-user/">interview at Ars Technica</a> that gives some background about what motivated this decision.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>TextMate 2 now require 10.7</p></li>
<li><p>When opening an already open folder (e.g. <code>mate .</code>) the window with that folder is brought to front <span class='credit'>Adam Strzelecki</span></p></li>
<li><p>When no URL is given in a <code>txmt</code> URL then current document is used (this affected e.g. clicking errors in a ruby stack dump when running untitled files) <span class='credit'>Gerd Knops</span></p></li>
<li><p>Opening <code>txmt</code> URLs with escaped spaces no longer fail <span class='credit'>Gerd Knops</span></p></li>
<li><p>git: If a folder contains files with mixed status, the folder itself now gets a badge <span class='credit'>Gerd Knops</span></p></li>
<li><p>SCM badges are now enabled for disk images <span class='credit'>Gerd Knops</span></p></li>
<li><p>Scope selectors now support anchoring matches by using <code>^</code>, <code>$</code>, and <code>&gt;</code> to anchor to either the first, last, or previous scope element <span class='credit'>Joachim Mårtensson</span></p></li>
<li><p>Subversion support (badges) has been disabled. The <code>libsvn.a</code> used was an older version which didn’t support the most recent repository format, and building the latest version gave rise to a few problems. Moving forward, I think subversion support should be re-added by calling the <code>svn</code> shell command to obtain status (this is the approach taken for both git and mercurial).</p></li>
<li><p>Absolute paths in the “Find in Folder” results now use the name of the disk instead of <code>/</code> as first element</p></li>
<li><p>git: Updated driver to work with the new way submodules have their metadata in the super project.</p></li>
<li><p>Tab triggers are no longer rendered in the menu. This is caused by the switch to the 10.7 SDK which no longer allow the old way of rendering these items. Replacement code is of course planned.</p></li>
<li><p>Projects with a <code>*.ninja</code> file now get the <code>attr.project.ninja</code> scope.</p></li>
<li><p>Sections in <code>.tm_properties</code> files can now target multiple globs/scopes by separating them with a semi-colon, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>[ source.ruby; *.rb ]
tabSize = 2
</code></pre></li>

<ul>
<li>Signed for Gatekeeper.</li>
<li>Using <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃K</kbd> at the end of a line now deletes the newline.</li>
<li>Implement <code>moveToBeginning/EndOfParagraphAndModifySelection:</code> selectors. The default key bindings have <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⇧E</kbd> extend selection to end of paragraph (so was previously a no-op in TM).</li>
<li>The <code>.tm_properties</code> parser no longer require spaces around the equal character nor is there a need to quote section names when they contain special characters, etc. The full grammar can be found in the help book.</li>
<li>Disable font ligatures. Using the Mensch font on Lion (but not Snow Leopard) would previously render ‘fi’ using the ‘fi’ ligature.</li>
<li>Fix drawing issues for Retina Mac Books (horizontal lines would appear while scrolling).</li>
<li>The Select Bundle Item window now use the same key equivalent control as the bundle editor.</li>
<li>Improve keyboard usage with key equivalent control. You can tab to/from the control, when the control has focus you can use forward/backward delete to remove the current key equivalent or space to record a new one. Clicking the control using the mouse will go directly to record mode.</li>
<li>When closing the preferences window pending edits of the variables will be committed.</li>
<li>If a bundle item contained an empty string for key equivalent, the bundle editor would crash when showing that item.</li>
<li>When recording a key equivalent in the bundle editor, global hotkeys are disabled. This means you can bind to keys that may not actually work on your system (because another application or system service is swallowing the event).</li>
<li>Commands which use ssh should now work even if the private key has a passphrase (e.g. the Subversion commands).</li>
<li>Improve clicking various UI elements (e.g. the close button in tabs) for inactive windows.</li>
<li>Add clear button to key equivalent recorder.</li>
<li>Fix file browser crash when duplicating files which had a suffix one character longer than the base name.</li>
<li>Support services.</li>
<li>Request administration rights when required by the software update process.</li>
<li>Fix missing repeat events (on Lion) for characters with no potential diacritics.</li>
<li>Fixed crash resulting from clicking and holding mouse exactly on a caret, starting a drag operation and dropping the (empty) selection.</li>
<li>Show dialog for (some) keychain failures. The license key is stored in and retrieved from the keychain, so errors will cause TextMate to not run. I suspect there is an issue where TextMate “loses” its signed state and is denied access to the keychain, as a few users have reported sudden problems which were resolved simply by moving TextMate on disk.</li>
<li>When switching tabs, selection was drawn as if in a background window.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Improved SCM workaround for Mercurial issue — previous workaround could leave SCM status outdated, this should no longer be the case.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix problem with items that differed only in capitalization. These were collapsed into a single item in several UI menus/dialogs, e.g. Open Favorites.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix bad encoding when copying Find in Folder / Find All results.</p></li>
<li><p>Using Go to Counterpart no longer include files matched by the effective <code>binary</code> or <code>exclude</code> glob from <code>.tm_properties</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Changed <code>binary</code> setting in <code>.tm_properties</code> from a boolean to a glob. This allows to set a global binary glob instead of needing to set the boolean for specific settings (which is more complex to manage via a GUI).</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce <code>attr.file.unknown-type</code> and <code>attr.file.unknown-encoding</code>. You can use this in <code>.tm_properties</code> files to set <code>fileType</code> and <code>encoding</code> to provide default values only for files where TextMate was unable to find the proper type/encoding (which normally results in a dialog asking the user).</p></li>
<li><p>Cached <code>.tm_properties</code> files are now observed via <code>kevent</code> so changes invalidate the cache immediately (previously it could take up to 30 seconds before the updated file was read). On file systems without <code>kevent</code> support you need to relaunch TextMate to flush the cache.</p></li>
<li><p>The sections in <code>.tm_properties</code> files are now considered real scope selectors. As the syntax for globs and scope selectors is the same, the latter must start with <code>attr</code>, <code>source</code>, or <code>text</code> to indicate it is a scope selector. If your desired scope selector does not, you can always prefix it (with the always present <code>attr</code>) e.g.: <code>[ &quot;attr - attr.scm&quot; ]</code> to have settings for files not under version control. This should just be temporary while exact requirements are being fleshed out.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce <code>TM_SCM_BRANCH</code> variable (mainly useful for setting <code>windowTitle</code> in <code>.tm_properties</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>You can augment the rules for scope attributes by saving a property list to <code>~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/ScopeAttributes.plist</code>. Your rules will be added to the default list which is:</p>

<pre><code>{
    rules = (
        { attribute = 'attr.scm.svn';       glob = '.svn';        group = 'scm';   },
        { attribute = 'attr.scm.hg';        glob = '.hg';         group = 'scm';   },
        { attribute = 'attr.scm.git';       glob = '.git';        group = 'scm';   },
        { attribute = 'attr.scm.p4';        glob = '.p4config';   group = 'scm';   },
        { attribute = 'attr.project.make';  glob = 'Makefile';    group = 'build'; },
        { attribute = 'attr.project.rake';  glob = 'Rakefile';    group = 'build'; },
        { attribute = 'attr.project.xcode'; glob = '*.xcodeproj'; group = 'build'; },
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>group</code> is to allow mutually exclusive attributes. E.g. if a folder contains both a <code>Rakefile</code> and a <code>Makefile</code> entry, files in that folder only get the <code>attr.project.make</code> attribute set since the two tests are in same group (and the <code>Makefile</code> test is listed first).</p></li>
<li><p>Added <em>View → Show Wrap Column</em> setting and corresponding <code>showWrapColumn</code> <code>.tm_properties</code> setting.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduced <code>fontLeadingDelta</code> and <code>fontAscentDelta</code> defaults keys. These must be set as floats or integers (not strings), e.g.: <code>defaults write com.macromates.TextMate.preview fontLeadingDelta -float 0</code>. The default value for both keys is <code>1</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use of extended attributes can now be disabled. The defaults key is <code>volumeSettings</code> and the value is an associative array with path prefix and another associative array with settings for that path (presently only <code>extendedAttributes</code> is supported, but SCM badges, display names, and more is likely to appear). So if for example we wish to disable extended attributes for files under <code>/net/</code> we can do: <code>defaults write com.macromates.TextMate.preview volumeSettings '{ &quot;/net/&quot; = { extendedAttributes = 0; }; }'</code>.</p></li>
<li>Some improvements to file chooser (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘T</kbd>):

<ul>
<li>Current document is now included in list, and if typed exactly, will rank at top.</li>
<li>Filter string is now down-cased with spaces removed before matching to cater to the habits of some users.
<!-- - Typing `:` or `@` without a filter string will go to line/symbol in current file (rather than currently selected file). --></li>
<li>Raw paths are shown instead of display names, which should be faster (especially on network file systems).</li>
<li>Subtle ranking improvements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The font size unit parser (for themes) is no longer locale sensitive (so period is always <code>.</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>The collapse/expand all button for the Find in Folder results did not properly refresh the outline view on Lion.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement option page up/down (for moving caret).</p></li>
<li><p>Set <code>initialFileBrowserURL</code> defaults key (to a URL) to change the initial location of the file browser (for new windows). E.g.: <code>defaults write com.macromates.TextMate.preview initialFileBrowserURL &quot;file://$HOME/Source/&quot;</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Default location for <code>mate</code> is now <code>/usr/local/bin</code> (if it exists) as this is included in the <code>PATH</code> for most users.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix failure to install <code>mate</code> when the install path existed as a dead symbolic link.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix issues with involuntary (recursive) expansion of file browser.</p></li>
<li><p>Support transparent backgrounds in themes.</p></li>
<li><p>Exclude binary matches for folder searching.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s now possible to change case in the file browser (previously a “file exists” error was shown for case-insensitive systems).</p></li>
<li><p>Fix issue with the <code>txmt:</code> URL scheme (though omitting the <code>file</code> parameter is still not supported).</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Rename <em>Beta Builds</em> to <em>Nightly Builds</em> (Preferences → Software Update). This will be semi-daily builds that might have minor regressions (like e.g. the out-of-date SCM badges mentioned below), as I plan to do these frequently (but at most once per day). With Christmas coming up in four days (and me being in charge this year) don’t expect too many updates in the coming days though; I’m still working my way through reported issues.</li>
<li>Don’t add documents to recent menu when opened via file browser.</li>
<li>Fix the previously introduced <code>callback.application.did-(de)activate</code> semantic classes.</li>
<li>Asking for SCM status now use selected folder over file browser root.</li>
<li>Provide document name in Save As dialog.</li>
<li>Fix issue with proxy auto-configuration scripts.</li>
<li>The <code>htmlOutputPlacement</code> defaults value can now be set to <code>right</code> to get the split to the right of the document. The width is presently not persisted across relaunches (and defaults to 100px).</li>
<li>Throttle SCM status polls. This is a provisional fix for mercurial issues which can cause SCM badges to be out of date.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="">2011-12-18</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Introduced <code>callback.application.did-activate</code> and <code>callback.application.did-deactivate</code> as two new semantic classes. A command with this class will be executed when the application gain/lose focus. The scope selector is matched against the “current scope” of the visible document (in each window). This allows creating a command with “Save” set to “Modified Documents” and thereby recreating TextMate 1.x’s ability to save modified documents on lost focus.</p>

<p>The approach in 2.0 also allows to run some code, for example reloading the currently open browsers, and it can be scoped e.g. to <code>text.html</code> to only have the “save on lost focus” enabled when editing HTML files — alternatively one can introduce a custom scope like <code>attr.save-on-deactivate</code> and set that for specific projects via a <code>scopeAttributes</code> setting in <code>.tm_properties</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Tab bar can be made always visible: <code>defaults write com.macromates.TextMate.preview disableTabBarCollapsing -bool YES</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix issue with indented soft wrap having the prefix string wider than the wrap column.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix issue with selection sent to commands needing entire document (e.g. <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘R</kbd> for Ruby, Python, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Fix issue with <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⇥</kbd> not always working to move focus to file browser.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove folding patterns from grammar template.</p></li>

<li>File browser can be placed on the right side: <code>defaults write com.macromates.TextMate.preview fileBrowserPlacement right</code>.</li>
<li>With multiple carets, <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘</kbd>-clicking one of them removes it (i.e. it’s a toggle).</li>

<h2 id="">2011-12-13</h2>

<p>Notable changes since to TextMate 1.5.10:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Multiple carets / discontinuous selection</strong></p>

<p>The easiest way to get multiple carets is by doing a left or right movement command (like arrow left/right) with a column selection. You can also <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘</kbd>-click to place new carets or use <em>Edit → Find All</em> (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥⌘F</kbd>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Snippets</strong></p>

<p>New syntax for pop-up menus: <code>${1|first,second,…,last|}</code>. In a Git commit message try <kbd class='tabTrigger'>fixup⇥</kbd> to get a pop-up of your last 10 commit messages (for a <code>fixup!</code>-commit) or between <code>@interface</code>…<code>@end</code> in Objective-C you can try <kbd class='tabTrigger'>prop⇥</kbd> to get a <code>@property</code>-declaration with pop-up for its access type.</p>

<p>Snippets can be nested, a frequent request but it does cause a few false firings of snippets which we haven’t yet found a good solution for.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Movement / Selection</strong></p>

<p>Text is classified into units which you can change with the <code>characterClass</code> (scope) setting. For example a C string with <code>%1$ld\n</code> has only two units (<code>%1$ld</code> and <code>\n</code>) for the purpose of selection (<em>Select → Word</em> or double click), word movement (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥⇠</kbd>/<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥⇢</kbd>), and other functions that rely on character types.</p>

<p>TextMate 1.x has <em>Select → Block</em> (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧⌘B</kbd>) where a block is found using scope-defined paired characters such as braces, brackets, etc. In 2.0 you can move to begin/end of such block with <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⇡</kbd>/<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌃⇣</kbd> and the paired characters can be strings (planned to be patterns).</p>

<p>Whenever you select a unit (like anything in the <em>Edit → Select</em> submenu) the selection is “unanchored”, meaning it can be extended to either the left or right side. A minor thing but I find it surprisingly useful, e.g. to select <code>foo(bar‸)</code> we first select the parenthesis with <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧⌘B</kbd> and then extend left by one unit with <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌥⇧⇠</kbd>, previously you couldn’t be sure the last step would extend or simply move the selection end point.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Themes</strong></p>

<p>There now is the ability to change font and font size per scope. So you’ll (by default) see that headings in markup are shown with a larger (non-fixed width) font.</p>

<p>You can also change soft wrap on a per-line basis, so soft wrap is e.g. disabled (by default) for diffs embedded in Git commit messages, raw (code) blocks embedded in markup, and enabled for line comments in source.</p>

<p>Soft wrap can be indented. This is also based on scoped settings so list items in markup are indented differently than line comments in source.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Foldings</strong></p>

<p>Foldings have been taken out of grammars and are now per-line (via scoped settings). In addition there are two new patterns to allow folding indented blocks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indent</strong></p>

<p>TextMate is more aggressive about doing indent corrections. This works great when the patterns are well-calibrated but can be disabled with the <code>disableIndentCorrections</code> scope-setting. This setting also change the behavior of re-indented paste to a heuristic that works much better with Python (for which indent corrections are disabled by default).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Folder specific settings</strong></p>

<p>Variables and some settings can be set on a folder / file-type basis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Project drawer</strong></p>

<p>The project drawer has been replaced with a file browser sidebar. This file browser has most Finder functions (labels, duplicate, etc.) and does SCM-badging, presently only for Subversion, Git, and Mercurial. In addition it has support for running commands (although somewhat proof-of-concept ATM) and can also do custom data sources, the API is not yet public but an SCM Status data source is included (the smart folder icon) which show SCM status for the current project. This data source works great together with the various SCM bundles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Buffer completion</strong></p>

<p>This has been improved to work with the existing word suffix (in addition to prefix), use the new character class system, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shell invocation</strong></p>

<p><em>Preferences → Terminal</em> allows you to install <code>mate</code> which has a few new options and work when called as <code>sudo mate</code>. In addition you’ll find <code>rmate</code> which is a ruby implementation that you can use on a server over ssh.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Search in project / folder</strong></p>

<p>Revamped the old “Find in Folder” and merged it with the regular find dialog. It’s now asynchronous, a lot faster, and more flexible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Format strings</strong></p>

<p>Format strings are ubiquitous in TextMate 2. Even scopes in grammars are format strings (allowing you to capture document content for use in scopes) and format strings are more powerful than the 1.x variant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scopes</strong></p>

<p>Scopes now contain info beyond document context. For example the <code>attr.scm</code> scopes give info about the current file’s SCM status, allowing using same key equivalent for different SCM systems.</p>

<p>The <code>dyn</code> scopes give info such as “is there a selection” (allowing to change key bindings only when there is or isn’t a selection), an example of this is overloading <code>{</code> to “wrap selection” (nicely), but leave the key alone when there is no selection. Another use-case could be to change tab to shift the text right (indent) only when there is a selection (common user request that I don’t plan to make native behavior).</p>

<p>You can also add your own stuff to the scope via the file and folder specific settings which allows e.g. adding <code>attr.test</code> to your unit tests and overload <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘R</kbd> for that scope or have certain snippets only fire in that scope (e.g. we have a <kbd class='tabTrigger'>main⇥</kbd> snippet for C which inserts the venerable main function — makes sense to overload this for (C) unit tests, which generally would be regular C files).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scope selectors</strong></p>

<p>The caret is actually between two scopes, the left and right characters scope. In 2.0 we finally allow you to explicitly target either side (or both), making the firing of certain overloads more correct. There are also a few other new things related to scope selectors, but a lot of it is still only implemented in the parser, so will delay the thorough explanation of this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Commands</strong></p>

<p>Commands can require other bundles which allow them to reference support files in the required bundle. They can also declare which shell commands they need which means better error handling and also having TextMate try to find the required commands. Failing commands result in more graceful error dialogs. The output options for a command has been split into location and format. Commands can run without a document.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grammars</strong></p>

<p>Grammars can be injected into existing scopes, for example there are now grammars for marking URLs, <code>TODO</code>, and similar which are injected into comments and other appropriate places.</p>

<p>Various other things related to parsing which require its own post.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Semantic classes</strong></p>

<p>Bundle items can now be assigned a semantic class. This allows us to query for e.g. <code>action.build || action.run</code> (for current scope) to find an appropriate build command (with a run command as fallback). The advantage of this is manyfold: ability to do tool bars, palettes, and unified key bindings, for example we have a single <em>proxy item</em> bound to <kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⌘Y</kbd> which does a query for <code>action.scm</code> finding all the SCM actions relevant for the current scope (remember scope now include SCM info, making it pick the proper SCM system).</p>

<p>Proxy items are a new construct but still at the proof-of-concept level, so more about this later.</p>

<p>TextMate itself will also do queries at various times, for example when opening a file it queries for import commands, where we include several to decompile AppleScript, pretty-print binary property lists, and similar. It also uses this system on save, so by default we now make new scripts with a shebang executable after save.</p>

<p>Like proxy items, this system is in its infancy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Managed bundles</strong></p>

<p>When you open a file type for which you have no bundle, you’ll be asked to install one (if TextMate knows of one). Bundles are automatically kept up to date and you can see installed bundles (and install more) in <em>Preferences → Bundles</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Session restore</strong></p>

<p>TextMate restores the full session which includes unsaved changes incase of abnormal exit. Hold shift (<kbd class='keyEquivalent'>⇧</kbd>) during launch to bypass.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Foreign Input Modes</strong></p>

<p>Display of CJK and “advanced” input modes is now be supported (although only limited testing has been done).</p></li>
